# Android_Coffee_Order_App
Order coffee and submit the order by email
Greetings. This app is a coffee ordering app where your order details appear in an email, ready to be sent to a friend. 
Once pressing "order", the app will direct you to an email app, like gmail, where your order details are stored in the body of the email, ready to be sent.
The way this is achieved is by using implicit intents. An intent that uses an emailing app. I have attached some intent extras, such as subject of the email
and body text of the email. The user proceeds by entering a recipient email of their choice to send their order.

One extra bonus that you can't forget. The app also works in the Dutch language. Go ahead and use Dutch as your phone's preferred language, 
and watch how the English gets translated to Dutch automatically. Android can detect your preferred language and change the app's language according to your preferred language.
You can change your phone's language by going into settings.

The app calculates the order price using your local currency. If British English is your phone's language, then watch the British pound sign Â£ pop up. 
And if you use Dutch, prepare to see the Euro sign pop up. Interesting indeed. I remember a time when the British pound was actually strong. Good times. All before brexit
